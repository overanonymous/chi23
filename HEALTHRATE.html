      <h1>Task #1</h1>
      <h2>Task Instructions</h2>
      <p>
        You will be shown a product category title (e.g., canned soup) and a list of five product claims to review. 
        After reviewing the product category and list of claims, you will rate the food's healthfulness on a 10-point scale where 1 = Not Healthy, while 10 = Very Healthy for how healthy you think the food product is.
      </p>
      <p>
        After rating the item, you will then be presented with a nutrition label and narrative explanation for that same item. Review the label and narrative, then rate this food item on the
        10-point healthfulness scale (1 = Not Healthy; 10 = Very Healthy) based on how healthy you think the food item is.
      </p>
    </p>
    You will complete both parts in this task four times, where each time, you will see a new set of product claims and a different nutrition label format.
